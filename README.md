# BigNets

Testing EpiModel for big networks

## Setup

This project works with [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html).
Before trying to run the scripts, you must initialize it with `renv::init()` and
choose "Restore the project from the lockfile.". This will install the packages
dependencies in their correct versions.

*Note:* some packages are from private GitHub repositories. You need to have
access to them and have you [private Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) setup correctly.
